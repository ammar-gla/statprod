In R, use the following commands (from https://martinctc.github.io/blog/working-with-spss-labels-in-r/):

-glimpse() to see all variables with the first 20 or so rows, works well on giant SPSS datasets
-haven::read_sav() to load SPSS datasets with all variable and value labels
-attr(dta$var,"labels") will show the value labels, e.g. 'Male'=1
-sjPlot::view_df() to show overview of dataset with labels and all in HTML.

Note: variables with value labels are a unique class (haven_labelled) which you can check using class(dta$var)
these cannot be interchanged with chr and num variables easily, e.g. in a case_when.
